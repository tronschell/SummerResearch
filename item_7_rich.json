Third, mix within these categories was negative to margin, as in general COVID-related products had lower margins and increased in the mix. (2) A change in product mix. Fasteners are our largest and highest gross profit margin product line due to the high transaction cost surrounding the sourcing and supply of the product for customers. Our fastener product line declined to 29.9% of sales in 2020 from 34.2% of sales in 2019. (3) Overhead and organizational expenses. This includes the negative impact that reduced sales for certain product lines has on vendor rebates, clearance efforts to remove older and slower moving inventory, and the deleverage of certain fixed and period costs related to cyclical weakness in our traditional manufacturing and construction markets. These three adverse variables were partly offset by a better cost profile for our captive fleet. We operate our own fleet of trucks for moving product between suppliers, our distribution centers, and our in-market locations. We believe this provides us a competitive advantage in terms of our ability to move product efficiently and quickly, but there is a cost to supporting and maintaining these assets. During periods of economic weakness, it can become more difficult to charge freight to offset these costs and/or the relatively stable cost profile of these assets could result in deleverage.

During the year, we experienced supplier and customer disruption, which adversely affected our results of operations and cash flows in 2020.  In Europe and North America, sales began declining in the second half of March as the pandemic led to customer plant closures.  The situation grew more challenging in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2020, as customer closures affected much of our operations.  Although much of the United States and the global economies have reopened, many public health experts warn there may be additional COVID-19 surges in 2021.  Further surges in the COVID-19 infection rates could result in the reinstatement of directives and mandates requiring businesses to again curtail or cease normal operations, just as some jurisdictions rolled back reopening plans in the summer of 2020 during one of the initial COVID-19 surges.  Thus, the spread of COVID-19 and the responses thereto have created a disruption in the manufacturing, delivery, and overall supply chain of automobile manufacturers and suppliers, as well as disruption within the power industry.  Global vehicle production decreased significantly, and some vehicle manufacturers completely shut down manufacturing operations in some countries and regions, including the United States and Europe.

Our labor force is currently working remotely, which could, among other things, negatively impact our ability to conduct research and development activities, engage in sales-related initiatives, or efficiently conduct day-to-day operations, and we are aware that other businesses with which we engage are likely operating under similar restrictions and experiencing disruptions in their own operations, which may create obstacles in the coordination of business activities. Circumstances arising from the pandemic have slowed and could continue to slow the pace of enrollment in our clinical trials or otherwise hinder patients' abilities to comply with the clinical trial protocols and could ultimately delay the availability of results and analysis of outcomes. Disruptions in the supply chain could negatively impact our ability to source materials or manufacture and distribute product. While we do not currently anticipate a material reduction in demand for our commercialized products, we could experience a decrease in new patient identification and increased requests for patient assistance due to increased levels of unemployment, either of which would negatively impact our revenues and hinder our cash flows. Similarly, we could face challenges with regard to healthcare programs, including access and changes in coverage. Growth in revenue could also be impeded by these factors. The financial markets have been subject to significant volatility that could impact our ability to enter into, modify, and negotiate favorable terms and conditions relative to equity and debt financing activities. We had $361.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2020, which does not take into account $189.0\u00a0million in net proceeds we received in February 2021 pursuant to an underwritten public offering, which we believe provides sufficient capital to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. While we have not yet experienced a material impact to date, the full magnitude of the pandemic cannot be measured at this time, and therefore any of the aforementioned circumstances, as well as other factors, may cause our results of operations to vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter."

In addition, in order to preserve liquidity, we issued debt securities in May 2020 and we may in the future incur additional indebtedness, whether through the issuance of debt securities, drawdowns under our credit facility or otherwise.

In our Performance Chemicals segment, continued profitable growth in pavement technologies and a return to growth in engineered polymers is expected to be partially offset by somewhat lower volumes in oilfield technologies, and modest inflationary costs for freight and primary raw materials. Some risks to the 2021 outlook include lower than anticipated U.S., China, Canadian, and European vehicle sales and production, higher non-primary raw materials costs, a shift towards smaller vehicles in the U.S. (versus the shift towards light trucks as seen in recent years), and further declines in oil drilling and production in oilfield technologies, negative impacts from Brexit, and prolonged disruptions in the global supply chain. We expect to deliver fiscal year 2021 Adjusted EBITDA of $400 million to $420 million. These estimates assume that the first half of the year will continue to impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with improvements in economic conditions over the second half of the year."
