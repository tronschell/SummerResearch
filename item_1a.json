Our revenues declined substantially beginning in the second half of March 2020 because of COVID-19 and will remain suppressed while the current economic conditions continue. The operations of our clients have been severely disrupted, and could further decline, thereby increasing the likelihood that our clients continue to delay new contracts or cancel current contracts, reduce orders for our services in the future, have difficulty paying for services provided, or cease operations altogether. The rapid increase in unemployment has made it easier for clients to find new staff, reducing the demand for our services. In response to these adverse conditions we have taken steps to reduce our expenses and cash outflows. These reductions in expenses, including layoffs, could reduce our ability to take advantage of opportunities in the future if economic conditions improve. Further deterioration in economic conditions, as a result of COVID-19 or otherwise, will lead to a prolonged decline in demand for our services and negatively impact our business."

Additionally, many of AEC\u2019s customers, as well as the companies supplied by our customers are under pressure to achieve acceptable returns on their substantial investments in recent years in new technologies, new programs and new product introductions. This has contributed to a relentless focus on reducing costs, resulting in continuous pressure for cost reduction and pricing improvement throughout the supply chain. The recent wave of consolidation in the aerospace industry could continue or intensify these pressures."

For example, in 2020 we experienced a reduction in the rates of patient enrollment in our ongoing clinical trials as a result of the pandemic. Clinical site initiation and patient enrollment may be further delayed due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic and patients\u2019 ability or willingness to participate in clinical trials. For those patients who are enrolled and desire to continue in the clinical trials, some patients may not be able or willing to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines or governmental orders impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. Similarly, we may face increased challenges with the ability to recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19, which could adversely impact our clinical trial operations, timelines and outcomes. In addition, we rely on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations (CROs) and other third-party service providers to assist us in managing, monitoring and otherwise carrying out our clinical trials, and the pandemic may affect their ability to devote sufficient time and resources to our programs or to travel to sites to perform work for us. While we remain in close contact with our CROs, clinical sites and suppliers to attempt to assess the impacts that COVID-19 may have on our clinical trials and projected timelines and we continue to implement appropriate mitigating measures in accordance with recent FDA guidance in an effort to ensure the ongoing safety of the patients in our clinical trials and the continued collection of high quality data, there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful. As challenging as conducting clinical trials is during normal times, the risks, operational challenges and costs of conducting clinical trials has increased substantially during the pandemic.  "

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and is expected to continue to cause, a global slowdown in economic activity, a decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods and services, disruptions in global supply chains, and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. Because the severity, magnitude and duration of the pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain, vary by region, are rapidly changing and difficult to predict, its full impact on our operations and financial performance, as well as its impact on our near-term ability to successfully execute our strategic objectives, remains similarly uncertain and difficult to predict. Further, the pandemic\u2019s ultimate impact depends in part on many factors not within our control and which may vary by region (heightening the uncertainty as to the ultimate impact COVID-19 may have on our operations and financial performance), including, without limitation: restrictive governmental and business actions that have been and continue to be taken in response (including travel restrictions, work from home requirements, and other workforce limitations); economic stimulus, funding and relief programs and other governmental economic responses; the effectiveness of governmental actions; economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; levels of economic contraction or growth; the impact of the pandemic on health and safety; the pace of recovery if and when the pandemic subsides; and how significantly the number of cases increases as economies reopen and restrictive governmental and business actions are relaxed."

        "after": ". During the year ended December\u00a031, 2020, all of our segments experienced demand shifts for certain products that caused net sales to increase in certain product categories and decrease in other categories. We attribute these demand shifts to consumer and customer behavior surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and the movement and social distancing restrictions put in place to combat spreading of the virus, such as travel bans, country lock-downs, and school closings, as well as mask mandates. We also believe that the social distancing measures and mask mandates contributed to the decline in total cough cold illnesses during the fourth quarter of 2020, which resulted in a decline of net sales for cough cold products in our upper respiratory category. Going forward, the continued spread of the disease and the actions to slow it could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, our supply chains and other operations, our results of operations, consumer demand for our products and our ability to access capital. The magnitude of any such adverse impacts are not determinable, but could be material, depending on: the duration, intensity, and continued spread of the disease, including the emergence of new strains of the virus; the duration of business closure and similar government orders, business reopening procedures and the public's willingness to adhere to suggested safety measures; the availability, acceptability and effectiveness of currently approved and potential future vaccines and their effectiveness against new strains of the virus; the severity and duration of any economic downturn resulting from the pandemic; the effectiveness of the Company's efforts at mitigation; and other factors, both known and unknown, many of which are likely to be outside our control. In addition, to the extent that any increased sales of our products during the initial stages of the outbreak may reflect \"pantry stocking\", consumer demand for such products in future periods may be correspondingly reduced. Further, lower consumer demand for cough cold products in all our segments and certain other self-care products in our CSCI segment may continue, and volume of U.S. prescriptions could decrease in our RX segment in future periods depending on the course of the pandemic and related responses to combat the virus. It is also possible that a change in the course of the pandemic may affect consumer demand for products in future periods in ways we do not currently anticipate."

Certain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or a broader range of offerings. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to attract or retain qualified drivers and riders at a lower cost than us.

Furthermore, the economic sensitivity of drivers and riders on our platform may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our pricing methodologies may not enable us to compete effectively in these locations. Local regulations may affect our pricing in certain geographic locations, which could amplify these effects.
