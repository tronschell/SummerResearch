The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic or any other public health crisis adversely impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, its impact on the economy and market conditions, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. In 2020, the pandemic did not significantly disrupt our operations except for the impact it had on oil and natural gas prices."

Further, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited to, governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic (including shutdown orders, border closings, restrictions on travel and transport and workforce pressures); the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response on global and regional economies, travel, and economic activity; general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; commodity prices such as oil and gas, and the pace of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. We continue to expect lower demand and volume for products and services, supply chain disruptions, delays of deliveries and other factors related directly and indirectly to the COVID-19 pandemic. To the extent global vaccination programs do not achieve intended results and a longer period of economic and global supply chain and related disruption continues, the more adverse the impact will be on our business operations, financial performance and results of operations. As the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and our operations evolves, we will continue to assess our liquidity needs. A prolonged or worsening worldwide disruption could materially affect our future access to our sources of liquidity, particularly our cash flows from operations and access to credit markets, which could impact our financial condition, capitalization, and capital investments.  Additionally, a prolonged period of generating lower cash flows from operations could adversely affect our financial condition and the achievement of our strategic objectives. Conditions in the financial and credit markets may also limit the availability of funding or increase the cost of funding, which could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations."

These include, but are not limited to: the response of the government, businesses and individuals to the pandemic; an acceleration of the decline in the use of physical mail; the impact of the pandemic on the global economy and economic activity; the changing spending habits of consumers and businesses; disruptions in global supply chains; and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. In addition to having the effect of potentially heightening many of our other risk factors in this section, the COVID-19 pandemic may, or may continue to, adversely affect the following to the detriment of our business, including:"

In late March 2020, we temporarily reduced store hours and closed our sales floors in our company-operated paint stores to the general public, requiring our customers to order product online or via phone and to access their products via curbside pickup or delivery. We implemented remote, alternate and flexible work arrangements where possible, including implementing split shifts at facilities and remote work options for non-essential on-site functions, enhanced cleaning and sanitation procedures, transitioned some of our facilities to manufacture hand sanitizer for use in our facilities and surrounding communities, implemented domestic and international travel restrictions, implemented return to work and visitor screening protocols, and postponed or canceled hosting or attending large events.

We continue to experience occasional, temporary disruptions and closures of some of our facilities due to COVID-19. We also continue to see shifts in consumer behaviors and preferences, as well as impacts in the demand for some of our products. Since the first quarter of 2020, we have experienced an unprecedented surge in do-it-yourself (DIY) demand due to some of our customers spending more time at home and focusing on home improvement projects. As a result, our architectural business was quick to recover from the onset of the pandemic, while many of our industrial businesses are recovering at a slower pace as commercial and other industrial projects are delayed. While we expect demand levels to return to more normalized levels eventually, our ability to predict and meet any future changes in the demand for our products due to the pandemic remains uncertain. Although the raw materials used in the manufacturing, distribution, and sale of our products are typically available from various sources in sufficient quantities, and although we have not experienced significant raw material shortages, delays or increased costs to date, COVID-19 may result in increased costs and unexpected shortages or delays in the delivery of some raw materials, each of which could be significant. We reduced spending in certain areas of our business, including through voluntary and involuntary leave programs and reductions in capital expenditures, temporarily suspending share repurchases and reducing discretionary spending, and we may need to take additional actions to reduce spending in the future."

Our suppliers and customers may also face these and other challenges, which could lead to a disruption in our supply chain as well as decreased demand, or our customers' inability to pay, for our products and services. The COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in periodic shortages of certain personal protective equipment (\"PPE\"), which may continue or worsen if the COVID-19 pandemic has a prolonged negative impact on the supply chain for PPE. An inability to procure PPE for operations may have a material adverse effect on our business, including potential shut down of certain facilities or operations. These issues may also materially affect our future access to our sources of liquidity, particularly our cash flows from operations, financial condition, capitalization, access to capital, and capital investments. Although these disruptions may continue to occur, the long-term economic impact and near-term financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to, possible additional impairment, restructuring, and other charges, cannot be reliably quantified or estimated at this time due to the uncertainty of future developments. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic affects our results will also depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and actions taken to contain the outbreak or treat its impact, among others."

Such events could affect the stability of our deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause us to incur additional expenses. Although we have established and regularly test disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations."

        "after": "On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (\u201cWHO\u201d) announced that the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) constituted a public health emergency of international concern.  On March 11, 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic and, on March 13, 2020, the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 outbreak a national emergency.  The health concerns relating to the COVID-19 outbreak and related governmental actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have significantly impacted the global economy (including the states and local economies in which we operate), disrupted supply chains, lowered equity market valuations, and created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets. The outbreak has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place or total lock-down orders and business limitations and shutdowns. Such measures have significantly contributed to rising unemployment and negatively impacted consumer and business spending. While quarantine and lock-down orders have been lifted and vaccination efforts are underway, COVID-19 has not yet been contained and commercial activity has not yet returned to the levels existing prior to the pandemic outbreak. As a result, the demand for the Company\u2019s products and services has been, and will continue to be, significantly impacted. "

The willingness and ability of patients to seek healthcare services have been negatively affected by restrictive measures, such as travel bans, social distancing, quarantines, and shelter-in-place orders. Elective procedures have been postponed by physicians and acute care hospitals and limited by governmental order to preserve capacity for the expected volume of COVID-19 patients and reduce the risk of the spread of COVID-19. Patients recovering from elective surgeries have historically represented approximately 15% of our home health admissions.\u00a0While not a significant percentage of our inpatient rehabilitation population, we treat patients who are recovering from elective surgery with multiple comorbidities and qualify for inpatient rehabilitation care. Additionally, many in need of treatment for more severe medical conditions have chosen not to seek care because of fear of infection. We are also experiencing supply chain disruptions as a result of the pandemic, including increased time between ordering and receiving supplies. We have experienced and are likely to continue to experience significant price increases in medical supplies, particularly personal protective equipment (\u201cPPE\u201d). The federal government began to undertake numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives designed to provide relief to the healthcare industry during the pandemic as described below in the \u201cSources of Revenue\u2014Medicare Reimbursement\u201d section. These initiatives have provided enhanced  flexibility to our hospitals and agencies to care for our patients and assist acute care hospitals in maintaining hospital capacity in the current environment. The pandemic is still rapidly evolving and much of its impact remains unknown and difficult to predict, with the impact on our operations and financial performance being dependent on numerous factors, including the ongoing nature of the pandemic, such as its rate of spread, duration, and geographic coverage; the rate and extent to which the virus mutates; the status of testing capabilities; the development, distribution, and administration of effective vaccines and other therapeutic remedies; the legal, regulatory, and administrative developments related to the pandemic at federal, state, and local levels, such as shelter-in-place orders, suspended services, and quarantines; and our infectious disease prevention and control efforts.

The global impact of the outbreak has been rapidly evolving and the responses of many countries, including the U.S., have included quarantines, restrictions on business activities, including construction activities, restrictions on group gatherings, and restrictions on travel. These actions are creating disruption in the global economy and supply chains and adversely impacting many industries, including owners and developers of office and mixed-use buildings. Moreover, there is significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to COVID-19, as well as its impact on the U.S. economy and consumer confidence. Demand for space at our properties is dependent on a variety of macroeconomic factors, such as employment levels, interest rates, changes in stock market valuations, rent levels and availability of competing space. These factors can be significantly adversely affected by a variety of factors beyond our control. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, many of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact our business in a number of ways, including: (i) deterioration in the financial condition of our tenants and in their ability to pay rents; (ii) reduction in demand for space in our portfolio; (iii) costs associated with construction delays and cost overruns at our development and redevelopment projects; (iv) reduction in availability of, and increased costs of, capital; and (v) failure of our contract counterparties, including partners in Real Estate Ventures, to meet their obligations.

        "before": "During the first quarter of 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) spread throughout the world, causing significant disruptions to the domestic and global economies which continue to date. In response to the outbreak, governments have imposed restrictions resulting in business shutdowns, regional quarantines, disruptions of supply chains, changes in consumer behavior and overall economic instability. This uncertainty has led to volatility in the financial markets. This impact was coupled with spikes in unemployment as a result of business shutdowns that continue to impact financial institutions operationally and financially. For a discussion of the risks we face with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, the associated economic uncertainty, the steps taken to mitigate the pandemic and the resulting economic contraction, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Various external factors influence the focus of our business efforts and the results of our operations can change significantly based on those external factors. Based on the latest real gross domestic product (\u201cGDP\u201d) information available, the Bureau of Economic Analysis\u2019 revised estimate of fourth quarter 2020 GDP growth was 4.0%, up from 2.1% GDP growth in the fourth quarter 2020. The acceleration in real GDP in the fourth quarter reflected increases in exports, nonresidential fixed investment, personal consumption expenditures, residential fixed investment, and private inventory investment that were partly offset by decreases in state and local government spending and federal government spending. Imports, which are a subtraction in the calculation of GDP, increased. The increase in fourth quarter GDP reflected both the continued economic recovery from the sharp declines earlier in the year and the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including new restrictions and closures that took effect in some areas of the United States. The full economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be quantified in the GDP estimate for the fourth quarter of 2020 because the impacts are generally embedded in source data and cannot be separately identified.",

The bill was designed to provide short-term economic relief to individuals and businesses most impacted by the fallout of the pandemic. Key provisions include: for individuals, economic impact payments and enhanced unemployment benefits; for small businesses, access to loans and support through the Small Business Administration Paycheck Protection Program (\u201cSBA-PPP\u201d), direct aid and loans to the medical industry and other affected sectors, and certain tax benefits that can be used in conjunction with the other aid mentioned. While direct aid to financial services entities is not a primary goal of the provisions, financial institutions will function to transmit funds from the Federal Reserve, SBA and United States (the \u201cU.S.\u201d) Treasury to the public. This was supplemented by the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act, which was signed into law on June 5, 2020 and amended provisions of the SBA-PPP including timing of the program and changes to forgiveness criteria. Additionally, the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2021 was signed into law on December 27, 2020, and contained provisions for new funding of SBA-PPP loans. We began accepting applications for this round of funding in the first quarter of 2021."

In December 2020, this CARES Act provision was extended to December 31, 2021.  The banking regulators issued similar guidance, which also clarified that a COVID-19-related modification would not meet the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to be a TDR if the borrower was current on payments at the time the underlying loan modification program was implemented and if the modification is considered to be short-term.  The Company generally offered impacted borrowers loan payment deferrals of 90 days in duration.  The Company offered subsequent 90 day deferrals if requested by the borrower.  Any deferred amounts were generally added by the Company to the payoff balance of the loan at maturity.  Most of the deferral requests occurred during the second quarter of 2020, and in the second half of 2020, most of those borrowers resumed payments.

These products, which we refer to as non-fastener product lines, tend to move through the same distribution channel, get used by the same customers, and utilize the same logistical capabilities as the original fastener product line. This logic is as true today as it was when we first began to diversify our product offering. However, over time, the supply chain for these product lines has evolved in ways independent of the fastener line. For instance, non-fastener product lines benefit disproportionately from our development of industrial vending. ",

This product line has enjoyed dramatic sales growth in the last ten years which we believe is directly attributable to our success in industrial vending over that period. The exception to this is the significant increase in safety sales as a percentage of consolidated net sales in 2020, which is directly attributable to dramatic increases in demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in that year. Our tools product line represented approximately 8.2%, 9.9%, and 10.0% of consolidated net sales in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively."

Second, in the third and fourth quarters of 2020 certain pandemic related products became oversupplied, and profits on our inventory fell (masks) while other products were in such short supply that cost rose (gloves). We mitigated these effects as the year progressed, but did not eliminate them. Third, mix within these categories was negative to margin, as in general COVID-related products had lower margins and increased in the mix. (2) A change in product mix. Fasteners are our largest and highest gross profit margin product line due to the high transaction cost surrounding the sourcing and supply of the product for customers. Our fastener product line declined to 29.9% of sales in 2020 from 34.2% of sales in 2019. (3) Overhead and organizational expenses. This includes the negative impact that reduced sales for certain product lines has on vendor rebates, clearance efforts to remove older and slower moving inventory, and the deleverage of certain fixed and period costs related to cyclical weakness in our traditional manufacturing and construction markets. These three adverse variables were partly offset by a better cost profile for our captive fleet. We operate our own fleet of trucks for moving product between suppliers, our distribution centers, and our in-market locations. We believe this provides us a competitive advantage in terms of our ability to move product efficiently and quickly, but there is a cost to supporting and maintaining these assets. During periods of economic weakness, it can become more difficult to charge freight to offset these costs and/or the relatively stable cost profile of these assets could result in deleverage. We successfully mitigated these challenges in 2020 by reducing movement and labor costs."

        "after": "The attractiveness of our services to customers and our ability to conduct business with certain customers can be affected by changes in U.S. and other countries' trade policies. In 2018, the U.S. imposed tariffs on a large variety of products of Chinese origin. The U.S. government also, effective May 10, 2019, increased tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25%. Further, on May 15, 2019, President Trump issued an executive order designed to secure the information and communications technology and services supply chain, which would restrict the acquisition or use in the United States of information and communications technology or services designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied by persons owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of foreign adversaries. The executive order is subject to implementation by the Secretary of Commerce and applies to contracts entered into prior to the effective date of the order. In addition, the U.S. Commerce Department has implemented additional restrictions and may implement further restrictions that would affect the conduct of business with certain Chinese companies. A \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal signed between the U.S. and China on January 15, 2020 accompanied a U.S. decision to cancel a plan to increase tariffs on an additional list of Chinese products and to reduce the tariffs imposed on May 13, 2019 from 15% to 7.5% effective February 14, 2020. At present, the majority of tariff exclusions granted have expired and many of the additional tariffs on Chinese origin goods remain, as do concerns over the stability of bilateral trade relations, particularly given the limited scope of the phase one agreement. In addition, the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could make it harder for China to meet its obligations under the deal and increases the potential for China to invoke the deal\u2019s \u201cdisaster clause,\u201d which could further challenge US-China bilateral trade relations. Depending upon their duration and implementation as well as our ability to mitigate their impact, these tariffs, the executive order and its implementation and other regulatory actions could materially affect our business, including in the form of increased cost of goods sold, decreased margins, increased pricing for customers, and reduced sales. In addition, the 2020 U.S. presidential election and subsequent transition in the administration has resulted in additional uncertainty regarding the future of U.S. trade relations. At this time, there is no assurance that a broader trade agreement will be successfully negotiated between the United States and China to reduce or eliminate the existing tariffs. Further, one of our former customers, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., and some of its affiliates have been added to the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Entity List, and were recently made subject to enhanced restrictions designed to prevent them from having access to foreign-produced items using U.S.-origin semiconductor technology and equipment; we could be subject to reputational harm based on its business activities, including activities with sanctioned countries. In addition, some countries in which we operate, such as Brazil, Hungary, India, Mexico, Malaysia and Poland, have experienced periods of slow or negative growth, high inflation, significant currency devaluations or limited availability of foreign exchange. Furthermore, in countries such as China, Brazil, India and Mexico, governmental authorities exercise significant influence over many aspects of the economy, and their actions could have a significant effect on us. We could be seriously harmed by inadequate infrastructure, including lack of adequate power and water supplies, transportation, raw materials and parts in countries in which we operate. In addition, we may encounter labor disruptions and rising labor costs, in particular within the lower-cost regions in which we operate. Any increase in labor costs that we are unable to recover in our pricing to our customers could adversely impact our operating results."

        "match": "The attractiveness of our services to customers and our ability to conduct business with certain customers can be affected by changes in U.S. and other countries' trade policies. In 2018, the U.S. imposed tariffs on a large variety of products of Chinese origin. The U.S. government also, effective May 10, 2019, increased tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25%. Further, on May 15, 2019, President Trump issued an executive order designed to secure the information and communications technology and services supply chain, which would restrict the acquisition or use in the United States of information and communications technology or services designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied by persons owned by, controlled by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of foreign adversaries. The executive order is subject to implementation by the Secretary of Commerce and applies to contracts entered into prior to the effective date of the order. In addition, the U.S. Commerce Department has implemented additional restrictions and may implement further restrictions that would affect the conduct of business with certain Chinese companies. A \u201cphase one\u201d trade deal signed between the U.S. and China on January 15, 2020 accompanied a U.S. decision to cancel a plan to increase tariffs on an additional list of Chinese products and to reduce the tariffs imposed on May 13, 2019 from 15% to 7.5% effective February 14, 2020. At present, the majority of tariff exclusions granted have expired and many of the additional tariffs on Chinese origin goods remain, as do concerns over the stability of bilateral trade relations, particularly given the limited scope of the phase one agreement. In addition, the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could make it harder for China to meet its obligations under the deal and increases the potential for China to invoke the deal\u2019s \u201cdisaster clause,\u201d which could further challenge US-China bilateral trade relations. Depending upon their duration and implementation as well as our ability to mitigate their impact, these tariffs, the executive order and its implementation and other regulatory actions could materially affect our business, including in the form of increased cost of goods sold, decreased margins, increased pricing for customers, and reduced sales. In addition, the 2020 U.S. presidential election and subsequent transition in the administration has resulted in additional uncertainty regarding the future of U.S. trade relations. At this time, there is no assurance that a broader trade agreement will be successfully negotiated between the United States and China to reduce or eliminate the existing tariffs. Further, one of our former customers, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., and some of its affiliates have been added to the U.S. Department of Commerce\u2019s Entity List, and were recently made subject to enhanced restrictions designed to prevent them from having access to foreign-produced items using U.S.-origin semiconductor technology and equipment; we could be subject to reputational harm based on its business activities, including activities with sanctioned countries. In addition, some countries in which we operate, such as Brazil, Hungary, India, Mexico, Malaysia and Poland, have experienced periods of slow or negative growth, high inflation, significant currency devaluations or limited availability of foreign exchange. Furthermore, in countries such as China, Brazil, India and Mexico, governmental authorities exercise significant influence over many aspects of the economy, and their actions could have a significant effect on us. We could be seriously harmed by inadequate infrastructure, including lack of adequate power and water supplies, transportation, raw materials and parts in countries in which we operate. In addition, we may encounter labor disruptions and rising labor costs, in particular within the lower-cost regions in which we operate. Any increase in labor costs that we are unable to recover in our pricing to our customers could adversely impact our operating results."

These industry conditions, coupled with those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, has led to significant global economic contraction generally and in our industry in particular.  We expect to see continued volatility in oil and natural gas prices for the foreseeable future, which may, over the long term, adversely impact our business.  Continued depressed demand or prices for oil and natural gas would have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.  "

While we did not experience significant disruptions to our operations in 2020, we are unable to predict the impact on our business, including our cash flows, liquidity, and results of operations in future periods due to numerous uncertainties.  There is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to spread and the extent and duration of governmental and other measures implemented to slow the spread of the virus, such as large-scale travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business and government shutdowns.  Restrictions of this nature may cause, us, our suppliers and other business counterparties to experience operational delays, or delays in the delivery of materials and supplies.  We expect the principal areas of operational risk for us are the availability and reliability of service providers and potential supply chain disruption.  Additionally, the operations of our midstream service providers, on whom we rely for the transmission, gathering and processing of a significant portion of our produced natural gas, NGL and oil, may be disrupted or suspended in response to containing the outbreak, or the difficult economic environment may lead to the  bankruptcy or closing of the facilities and infrastructure of our midstream service providers. This may result in substantial discount in the prices we receive for our produced natural gas, NGL and oil or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for our properties.",

Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, economic and health conditions in the United States and across most of the globe have changed rapidly. Customer demand across all segments, particularly our Beauty + Home and Food + Beverage segments, may decrease further from historical levels depending on the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the extent of further resurgences, the availability, adoption and effectiveness of a vaccine, the length of time it takes for normal economic and operating conditions to resume, additional governmental actions that may be taken and/or extensions of time for restrictions that have been imposed to date, and numerous other uncertainties. Such events may result in business and manufacturing disruption, inventory shortages due to disruptions to our supply chain and distribution channels, delivery delays, increased risk associated with customer payments and reduced sales and operations, any of which could materially affect our stock price, business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.",

The health and safety of our workforce is of primary concern and we may need to enact further precautionary measures to help minimize the risk of our employees being exposed to the virus and overall organization fatigue. Further, our management team is focused on mitigating the adverse effects of the\u00a0COVID-19 pandemic, which has required and will continue to require a large investment of time and resources across the entire company, thereby diverting their attention from other priorities that existed prior to the outbreak of the pandemic. Incremental operating costs related to heightened cleaning and sanitizing procedures at our factories, personal protective equipment for our employees and temporary labor costs necessary to address absenteeism, among others, will be necessary as the pandemic continues in the near-term.  If these conditions worsen, or last for an extended period of time, our ability to manage our business may be impaired, and operational risks, cybersecurity risks and other risks facing us even prior to the pandemic may be elevated."

Consistent with actions taken by governmental authorities and in response to reduced customer demand, in late March 2020, we idled manufacturing operations in certain regions around the world, other than China, where manufacturing operations began to resume in March 2020.  During the year, we experienced supplier and customer disruption, which adversely affected our results of operations and cash flows in 2020.  In Europe and North America, sales began declining in the second half of March as the pandemic led to customer plant closures.  The situation grew more challenging in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2020, as customer closures affected much of our operations.  Although much of the United States and the global economies have reopened, many public health experts warn there may be additional COVID-19 surges in 2021.  Further surges in the COVID-19 infection rates could result in the reinstatement of directives and mandates requiring businesses to again curtail or cease normal operations, just as some jurisdictions rolled back reopening plans in the summer of 2020 during one of the initial COVID-19 surges.  Thus, the spread of COVID-19 and the responses thereto have created a disruption in the manufacturing, delivery, and overall supply chain of automobile manufacturers and suppliers, as well as disruption within the power industry.  Global vehicle production decreased significantly, and some vehicle manufacturers completely shut down manufacturing operations in some countries and regions, including the United States and Europe.

The increase in revenues was due to the benefit of acquisitions of 2.6%, favorable foreign currency translation of 0.9% and organic growth of 3.5%, partially offset by a business disposition of 0.5%. The increase in organic revenue was primarily driven by COVID-19 PCR testing through its Central Laboratories unit along with broad based demand including COVID-19 vaccine and therapeutic work, partially offset by the negative impact from the pandemic. The pandemic continues to cause delays in clinical trial progression and associated testing, reductions in investigator site access, as well as interruptions to the supply chain. "

In the second half of March 2020, daily volume for routine tests started to decline as a result of decreased consumer demand driven by a significant reduction in physician office visits, the cancellation of elective medical procedures, and the negative impacts on discretionary spending resulting from the economic downturn, among other factors. In addition, the performance of the Company\u2019s drug development business was challenged by COVID-19 due to actions that clients have taken and are taking that slowed clinical trial progress and the associated testing as well as restrictions in trial site access in certain countries and interruptions in the supply chain. Given the continued unpredictability pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic and the corresponding government restrictions and customer behavior, the impact on the Company's business continues to be uncertain and depends on a number of evolving factors that the Company may not be able to predict or effectively respond to."

On April 9, 2020, the Company announced an agreement to collaborate on a comprehensive U.S.-based COVID-19 patient data registry. The Company also launched a self-collection kit for its COVID-19 PCR test under an emergency use authorization from the FDA, expanded availability of antibody tests to detect antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19, and launched a series of innovations to increase test capacity, throughput, and efficiency to maximize the use of supplies. The Company performed approximately 35 million COVID-19 tests in 2020, which represents about 31 million PCR tests and over 4 million antibody tests. As of February 25, 2021, the Company has the capacity to perform 275,000 PCR tests per day, but the Company's testing capacity is dependent on access to multiple testing platforms and the availability of equipment and testing supplies and key personnel. The Company's central laboratory business has also seen a significant increase in demand for sample collection supplies and kits and for clinical trials testing, which has put some pressure on the Company's supply chain and caused some delays in delivery of kit orders and clinical trial testing result delivery. Despite the Company's efforts to obtain adequate clinical trial kit and testing supplies and expand its capacity to make clinical trials collection kits and perform clinical trials testing, the Company may not be successful in meeting the increased demand, and the Company\u2019s customers and other stakeholders may perceive the Company\u2019s responses to the pandemic as insufficient, inadequate or not equivalent to or better than competitors, including with respect to the availability of testing, collection  kits, and the amount of time it takes for delivery of test results or fulfillment of kit orders. Factors that may be out of the Company\u2019s control, such as the availability of equipment, supplies, and key personnel and geographical changes in demand, may impact the Company\u2019s ability to meet customer demand and the Company's other responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, and may have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations.

Government-coordinated administrative or allocation decisions at the federal, state, and local levels may cause variability in the timing and volume of COVID-19 vaccine distribution and administration activities.

Similar COVID-19 vaccine authorizations have occurred in Canada and Europe. McKesson Canada\u2019s corporately owned retail pharmacy chain, Rexall, as well as independent pharmacy banners are supporting Canada\u2019s vaccination efforts. McKesson Europe is also playing a role in helping support governments and public health entities in not only distributing COVID-19 vaccines across several European countries, but administering them in pharmacies as well.",

Many of these suppliers also supply parts for commercial aviation businesses which have been more significantly impacted by the pandemic due to the impacts on these markets. Global supply chain disruption caused by the response to COVID-19 has impacted some of our programs and could impact our ability to perform on our contracts, in particular in instances where there is not a qualified second source of supply. We have identified a number of suppliers that have experienced delivery impacts due to COVID-19 and have been working to manage those impacts. However, if alternatives or other mitigations are not effective, deliveries and other milestones on affected programs could be adversely impacted.",
        "match": "Our work in production facilities and labs has continued throughout the pandemic, consistent with guidance from federal, state and local officials to minimize the spread of COVID-19. We have taken actions to equip employees with personal protective equipment, establish minimum staffing and social distancing policies, sanitize workspaces more frequently, adopt alternate work schedules and institute other measures aimed to sustain production and related services while minimizing the transmission of COVID-19. In addition, we have implemented a flexible teleworking policy for employees who can meet our customer commitments remotely, and a significant portion of our workforce is currently teleworking. It remains uncertain when and on what scale teleworking employees will return to work in person. We have not previously experienced such a significant portion of our workforce working remotely for a prolonged period, so its effects on our long-term operations are unknown."

The Covid-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, reduced global demand for oil and gas, petroleum products and industrial products, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial and commodity markets. The extent of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, is uncertain and depends on various factors, including the demand for oil and natural gas, petroleum products and industrial products (including the impact that reductions in travel, manufacturing and consumer product demand have had and will have on the demand for commodities), the availability of personnel, equipment and services critical to our ability to operate our assets and the impact of potential governmental restrictions on travel, transportation and operations. There is uncertainty around the extent and duration of the disruption. The degree to which the Covid-19 pandemic or any other public health crisis adversely impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. These developments include, but are not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, its impact on the economy and market conditions, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. These potential impacts, while uncertain, could adversely affect our operating results."

In periods with limited availability of capacity and components in our supply chain, we may place non-cancellable inventory orders significantly in advance of our normal lead times, pay premiums or provide deposits to secure normal and incremental future supply, which could negatively impact our financial results. Demand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions and transitions, competitor announcements, and competing technologies, all of which can impact the timing and amount of our revenue. For example, our GPUs for gaming are capable of digital currency mining. Demand and use of GPUs for cryptocurrency has fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to change quickly. Volatility in the cryptocurrency market, including changes in the prices of cryptocurrencies, can impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may also create increased aftermarket resales of our GPUs and may reduce demand for our new GPUs. Additionally, consumer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased demand for our Gaming, Data Center and mobile workstation and laptop products and suppressed corporate demand for desktop workstations, has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand, and these challenges may be more pronounced in the future if and when the effects of the pandemic subside.

Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects of the COVID-19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable, could materially increase our costs, negatively impact our business and damage our results of operations and our liquidity position, possibly to a significant degree."

In addition, the pandemic has resulted in temporary closures of many businesses and the institution of social distancing and sheltering in place requirements in many states and communities, including those in our footprint. The pandemic has caused us, and could continue to cause us, increases in the Company's allowance for credit losses and subsequent increases in credit losses in our loan portfolios. Some of the risks the Company faces from the pandemic include, but are not limited to: the health and availability of our colleagues, the financial condition of our clients and the demand for our products and services, falling interest rates, recognition of credit losses and increases in the allowance for credit losses, especially if businesses remain closed or restricted, unemployment continues to rise and clients and customers draw on their lines of credit or seek additional loans to help finance their businesses, and a significant deterioration of business conditions in our markets. Furthermore, the pandemic has caused us to recognize impairment of our goodwill and there could be impairment of our financial assets. Sustained adverse effects may also increase our cost of capital, prevent us from satisfying our minimum regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory requirements, or result in downgrades in our credit rating.

We could be materially and adversely affected by the risks, or the public perception of the risks, related to an epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. We are continuing to monitor the global pandemic and spread of COVID-19 and plan to continue taking steps to identify and mitigate the adverse impacts on, and risks to, our business posed by its spread and actions taken by governmental and health authorities to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices, including implementing a global work from home policy for all employees who are able to perform their duties remotely and restricting all nonessential business travel, and we expect to continue to take actions as may be required or recommended by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, the patients we serve and other business partners in light of COVID-19 and variants thereof. Where and to the extent permitted to be open under local regulations, our office sites are operational with physical distancing, temperature screening, contact tracing and cleaning measures in place, as well as voluntary testing protocols in our Massachusetts facilities. At this time, we cannot predict when certain restrictions that are in place to protect our employees can be safely reduced or will no longer be needed, and such restrictions are likely to remain in place until there is widespread availability and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Due to the speed and fluidity with which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and the emergence of highly contagious variants, we do not yet know the full extent of the impact of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 on our business operations. The ultimate extent of the impact of any epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of such epidemic, pandemic, outbreak, or other public health crisis and actions taken to contain or prevent the further spread, including the availability and efficacy of vaccines, among others. Accordingly, we cannot predict the extent to which our business, financial condition and results of operations will be affected. We remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, liquidity and financial flexibility and continue to monitor developments as we deal with the disruptions and uncertainties from a business and financial perspective relating to COVID-19 and variants thereof. We will continue to work diligently with our partners and stakeholders to support patient access to our approved medicines, advance our product candidates under regulatory review as well as in our clinical studies to the extent safe to do so for patients, caregivers and healthcare practitioners, and ensure the continuity of our manufacturing and supply chain.

Lower demand for crude oil could also reduce the supply and therefore increase the cost of natural gas, which is the principal raw material used in our production of nitrogen fertilizers. In addition, lower crude oil prices, and a reduced demand for gasoline resulting from actions to slow the spread of COVID-19, have reduced ethanol production and therefore negatively impacted the demand for corn, which is a significant factor driving customer demand for our nitrogen fertilizers.

Simplification is critical to our future growth. Specific actions we have initiated as we began to implement our Full Potential plan include portfolio streamlining and SKU rationalization. We are streamlining our portfolio to increase our business focus and improve future returns. As a result of COVID-19 vaccines rolling out around the world along with slowing retail orders and a flood of competitive offerings, our future PPE sales opportunities have been dramatically reduced. Therefore, we do not view PPE as a future growth opportunity for our company. We recorded a charge of $374\u00a0million to write down our entire PPE inventory balance to its estimated net realizable value and a charge of $26\u00a0million to accrue for vendor commitments for PPE materials. Additionally, we commenced an initiative to reduce 20% of our SKUs in inventory in order to streamline product offerings while also implementing a formal lifecycle management process. As a result, we recorded a charge of $211\u00a0million to write down inventory to its estimated net realizable value taking into account our initiatives. These initiatives will position us for long-term growth by driving higher margin sales, lowering costs and improving service to customers. In addition, on February 9, 2021, as part of our strategic review, we announced that we are exploring strategic alternatives for our European Innerwear business."

During 2020, the rapid expansion of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a sharp decline in net sales and earnings in the Company\u2019s apparel businesses due to decreased customer traffic and temporary retail store closures worldwide. While many of the Company\u2019s retail stores were temporarily closed for varying periods of time throughout 2020, most were reopened by the end of the second quarter but have experienced, and are expected to continue to experience, reductions in customer traffic and therefore, net sales. In addition, many of the Company\u2019s wholesale customers have also experienced business disruptions, including lower traffic and consumer demand, resulting in decreased shipments to these customers. Sales of PPE, used to help mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus, partially offset the negative impact of the decline in net sales and earnings due to the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s financial results. In addition, the Company\u2019s e-commerce sites have remained open in all regions and online sales have grown as consumer spending continued to shift towards online shopping experiences due to the changing retail landscape as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company\u2019s operating results also reflected impairment charges related to intangible assets and goodwill, charges to reserve for increased excess and obsolete inventory, bad debt charges and charges to re-start the Company\u2019s supply chain following the extended shut-down of parts of its manufacturing network due to the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. While many retail stores reopened and some government restrictions were removed or lightened, many locations across the globe have experienced significant recent increases in COVID-19 cases as well as additional government restrictions, and the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains highly uncertain and could continue to have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business operations and financial results, including net sales, earnings and cash flows."

Pre-hedge oil realizations were negatively impacted during the second quarter and beginning of the third quarter as Antero sold volumes at a material discount to WTI in order to keep from shutting in production volumes.  This period of weak condensate demand driven by the pandemic coincided with an active well completion period for Antero that brought on large condensate volumes.  The negative impact from wider oil differentials was more than offset by the benefit of maintaining full natural gas and NGL volumes through this period.  Antero expects its full year 2021 realized oil price differential to be at the high end of the $9.00/Bbl to $11.00/Bbl range, as the differential normalized during the fourth quarter of 2020.",
        "after": "Our supply chain also has not experienced any significant interruptions.  The lack of a market or available storage for any one NGL product or oil could result in our having to delay or discontinue well completions and commercial production or shut in production for other products because we cannot curtail the production of individual products in a meaningful way without reducing production of other products.  Potential impacts of these constraints may include partial shut-in of production, although we are not able to determine the extent of shut-ins or for how long they may last.  However, because some of our wells produce rich gas, which is processed, and some produce dry gas, which does not require processing, we can change the mix of products that we produce and wells that we complete to adjust our production to address takeaway capacity constraints for certain products. For example, we can shut-in rich gas wells and still produce from our dry gas wells if processing or storage capacity of NGL products becomes further limited or constrained. Also, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had developed a diverse set of buyers and destinations, as well as in-field and off-site storage capacity for our condensate volumes, and such capacity is still largely available to us."

We believe that by demonstrating our product benefits and the shortcomings of existing insulin therapies, more people will choose our insulin pumps for their therapy needs, allowing us to further penetrate and expand the market worldwide. In addition, we believe publications, such as the results from studies using Control-IQ technology that were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in October 2019 and August 2020, and post-market real-world data will be valuable in demonstrating the clinical outcome benefits derived from our system to healthcare providers and payors.

Our labor force is currently working remotely, which could, among other things, negatively impact our ability to conduct research and development activities, engage in sales-related initiatives, or efficiently conduct day-to-day operations, and we are aware that other businesses with which we engage are likely operating under similar restrictions and experiencing disruptions in their own operations, which may create obstacles in the coordination of business activities. Circumstances arising from the pandemic have slowed and could continue to slow the pace of enrollment in our clinical trials or otherwise hinder patients' abilities to comply with the clinical trial protocols and could ultimately delay the availability of results and analysis of outcomes. Disruptions in the supply chain could negatively impact our ability to source materials or manufacture and distribute product. While we do not currently anticipate a material reduction in demand for our commercialized products, we could experience a decrease in new patient identification and increased requests for patient assistance due to increased levels of unemployment, either of which would negatively impact our revenues and hinder our cash flows. Similarly, we could face challenges with regard to healthcare programs, including access and changes in coverage. Growth in revenue could also be impeded by these factors. The financial markets have been subject to significant volatility that could impact our ability to enter into, modify, and negotiate favorable terms and conditions relative to equity and debt financing activities. We had $361.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2020, which does not take into account $189.0\u00a0million in net proceeds we received in February 2021 pursuant to an underwritten public offering, which we believe provides sufficient capital to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months.

Our response to that rebound has enabled our revenue to grow sequentially in the second half of fiscal year 2020, as we continue to deliver strong market outgrowth. For fiscal year 2020, we delivered 880 basis points of market outgrowth in our heavy vehicle and off-road (\"HVOR\") business and 690 basis points of market outgrowth in our automotive business. We continue to monitor all of our end markets and customers to ensure that our resources are balanced against forecasts and prioritized against critical growth opportunities.",
        "after": "Due in part to large-scale shutdowns early in 2020 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the automotive industry supply chain is currently facing a global shortage of semiconductors, the technology used to make microchips, resulting in paused production on certain vehicles and increased costs to procure microchips. We believe this shortage will have an adverse impact on our operating costs in fiscal year 2021. If the impacts of this shortage are more severe than we expect, it could result in further deterioration of our results, potentially for a longer period than currently anticipated."

In November 2020, the FDA deferred a decision on the BLA for DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar (frown) lines. The FDA reiterated that an inspection of our manufacturing facility is required as part of the BLA approval process, but the FDA was unable to conduct the required inspection of our manufacturing facility in Newark, California, due to the FDA\u2019s travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The FDA did not indicate there were any other review issues at the time beyond the on-site inspection. "

For example, enrollment in the JUNIPER Phase 2 adult upper limb spasticity trial was paused in March 2020 due to challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The trial was originally designed to include 128 subjects. Due to the COVID-19 challenges related to continued subject enrollment and the scheduling of in-person study visits, in June 2020, we announced the decision to end screening and complete the JUNIPER trial with the 83 patients enrolled to date.

Governmental responses during the pandemic have included orders closing businesses not deemed essential and directing individuals to restrict their movements, observe social distancing and shelter in place. These actions, together with responses to the pandemic by businesses and individuals, have resulted in rapid decreases in commercial and consumer activity, temporary closures of many businesses that have led to a loss of revenues and a rapid increase in unemployment, material decreases in oil and gas prices and in business valuations, disrupted global supply chains, market downturns and volatility, changes in consumer behavior related to pandemic fears, related emergency response legislation and an expectation that Federal Reserve policy will maintain a low interest rate environment for the foreseeable future."

The extent and duration of these impacts on us are dependent in part on demand for our products and services, customers\u2019 budgets, spending, willingness to allow "

        "before": "During the first half of 2020, the Company's transportation business was affected by COVID-19 and low oil prices. During this time, the most significant transportation-related impact of COVID-19 on operating results was a decrease year-over-year in exports from China to the U.S.  The impact of this dynamic was offset during the first quarter by strength in other sectors of Triumph Business Capital\u2019s (\u201cTBC\u201d) business in the first quarter of 2020, as freight volumes remained on par with seasonal expectations.  However, the aforementioned global supply disruption from China, in combination with the U.S. supply chain challenges due to business closures, shelter in place orders and an overall decrease in consumer demand was felt heavily in April and May of 2020 with a significant reduction in freight movement. During these months, the over-capacity market drove spot rates to decade-low numbers. In June, freight volumes resumed to 2019 levels or higher, and spot rates moved up accordingly. Many carriers who were inactive during April and May resumed to nearly full utilization. Small owner operators also returned to the market. ",
        "match": "During the second half of 2020, the Company\u2019s transportation businesses benefited from high freight volume in a reduced capacity market. Spot rates returned to mid-2018 highs in all trailer categories. This resulted in a significant rise in the average invoice price. This was unusual as diesel prices held steady or dropped slightly, indicating a majority of the increase related to capacity shortage in many markets. A portion of the increased freight was catch-up, as U.S ports reached capacity on incoming imports. Loads from Mexico rose to record high levels. The third quarter of 2020 saw many idle carriers respond to the higher spot rates and return to market, despite continued increases in insurance costs that threaten breakeven at lower freight rates. Purchases at TBC rose during the third quarter and rose again the following quarter. This reflected the capacity shortage and the beneficial pricing for those firms active in the market. It also reflected an increase in TBC clients. Driver pay has been increasing, insurance rates are up and diesel has been edging higher. Although there have been record Class 8 and tractor orders, delivery dates are being pushed further into 2021. This leaves capacity strained and costs high, so most project that rates will stay at current levels or slightly lower. If the economy is impacted by further stimulus and mass-scale vaccinations, 2021 could be a strong year for transportation. However, if the measures to curtail the economic impact of COVID-19 prove to be unsuccessful, we could experience an impact on our transportation business similar to that experienced during the first half of 2020."

        "after": ". During the year ended December\u00a031, 2020, all of our segments experienced demand shifts for certain products that caused net sales to increase in certain product categories and decrease in other categories. We attribute these demand shifts to consumer and customer behavior surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and the movement and social distancing restrictions put in place to combat spreading of the virus, such as travel bans, country lock-downs, and school closings, as well as mask mandates. We also believe that the social distancing measures and mask mandates contributed to the decline in total cough cold illnesses during the fourth quarter of 2020, which resulted in a decline of net sales for cough cold products in our upper respiratory category. Going forward, the continued spread of the disease and the actions to slow it could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, our supply chains and other operations, our results of operations, consumer demand for our products and our ability to access capital. The magnitude of any such adverse impacts are not determinable, but could be material, depending on: the duration, intensity, and continued spread of the disease, including the emergence of new strains of the virus; the duration of business closure and similar government orders, business reopening procedures and the public's willingness to adhere to suggested safety measures; the availability, acceptability and effectiveness of currently approved and potential future vaccines and their effectiveness against new strains of the virus; the severity and duration of any economic downturn resulting from the pandemic; the effectiveness of the Company's efforts at mitigation; and other factors, both known and unknown, many of which are likely to be outside our control. In addition, to the extent that any increased sales of our products during the initial stages of the outbreak may reflect \"pantry stocking\", consumer demand for such products in future periods may be correspondingly reduced. Further, lower consumer demand for cough cold products in all our segments and certain other self-care products in our CSCI segment may continue, and volume of U.S. prescriptions could decrease in our RX segment in future periods depending on the course of the pandemic and related responses to combat the virus. It is also possible that a change in the course of the pandemic may affect consumer demand for products in future periods in ways we do not currently anticipate."

While the majority of employees continue to work from home, we have continued to evaluate and update this policy for each of our locations and field-based employees based on guidance from federal, state and local government authorities and the severity of the pandemic. For our ongoing and planned clinical trials, while we anticipate and have experienced some delays or disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular with respect to activation of additional clinical trial sites and patient enrollment rates, we have continued to work with any impacted clinical trial sites to ensure study continuity, enable medical monitoring, facilitate study procedures and maintain clinical data and records, including the use of local laboratories for testing and tumor imaging, home delivery of study drug and remote data and records monitoring. In addition, we currently have sufficient supply or plans for supply to meet our anticipated global commercial and clinical development needs for our approved drugs and clinical-stage drug candidates through 2022. However, depending on the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on local and global supply chains, our suppliers could be adversely impacted, which may result in delays or disruptions in our current or future supply chain. For our commercial activities for AYVAKIT/AYVAKYT and GAVRETO, we are committed to continuing to serve the needs of healthcare providers, patients and other stakeholders during this critical time, including by conducting commercial and medical affairs field activities across our portfolio in virtual formats where possible. We will continue to assess the duration, scope and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the existing and potential impacts on our business, operations and financial performance, and we will continue to work closely with our third-party vendors, collaborators and other parties in order to seek to advance our pipeline of targeted therapies as quickly as possible, while making the health and safety of our employees and their families, healthcare providers, patients and communities a top priority.

Governmental responses to the pandemic have included orders closing businesses not deemed essential and directing individuals to restrict their movements, observe social distancing and shelter in place. These actions, together with responses to the pandemic by businesses and individuals, have resulted in decreases in commercial and consumer activity, temporary closures of many businesses that have led to a loss of revenues and an increase in unemployment, material decreases in business valuations in numerous industries, disrupted global supply chains, market volatility, changes in consumer behavior related to pandemic fears, related emergency response legislation and an expectation that Federal Reserve policy will maintain a low interest rate environment for the foreseeable future. During the second half of 2020, regions of the United States were experiencing various levels of restrictions and closures, but overall, personal and business activities still have not returned to their previous normal levels as the virus continues to impact the population.",

The effects of the outbreak on us could be exacerbated given that the outbreak, and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate the outbreak, may increasingly have significant negative effects on consumer discretionary spending and demand for and repayment of our products. Further, many of our customers are experiencing layoffs, slowdowns, work stoppages and other changes in work and financial circumstances, diminishing their demand for loans, eligibility for loans and ability to repay loans. In addition, efforts we take in response to the pandemic, such as expanding our payment flexibility programs, or to mitigate the effects of the pandemic, such as implementing underwriting changes to address credit risk associated with originations during the economic crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic, have had and may continue to have other effects on our business and results of operations, such as by reducing loan origination volume, or may not be successful or may have other effects on our business and results of operations such as, for example, decreasing the average annual percentage rate (\"APR\") of our products.

In addition, public and private sector responsive measures, such as the imposition of travel restrictions, quarantines, adoption of remote working, and suspension of non-essential business and government services, have impacted the Company\u2019s business and financial condition. Many of DuPont\u2019s facilities and employees are based in areas impacted by the virus. While most DuPont manufacturing sites remain in operation, DuPont has reduced or furloughed certain operations in response to government measures, employee welfare concerns and the impact of COVID-19 on the global demand and supply chain. DuPont\u2019s manufacturing operations may be further adversely affected by impacts from COVID-19 including, among other things, additional government actions and other responsive measures, more and /or deeper supply chain disruptions, quarantines and health and availability of essential onsite personnel. In response, the Company developed site-by-site protocols in 2020 under which the Company continues to operate. These protocols include pre-entrance screening, restricting visitor access, social distancing and masking requirements, additional sanitization and disinfecting requirements, restrictions on all nonessential travel and implementation of work-from-home protocols. The suspension of travel and doing business in-person has increased the Company\u2019s exposure to cybersecurity risks and could negatively impact the Company's innovation and marketing efforts, challenge the ability to deliver against the Company\u2019s strategic priorities and to otherwise transact business in a timely manner, or create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm DuPont\u2019s business.

DuPont\u2019s financial results may be materially and adversely impacted by a variety of factors that have not yet been determined, including potential impairments of goodwill and other assets. DuPont is taking actions, including reducing costs, restructuring actions, and delaying certain capital expenditures and non-essential spend.

For the duration of the pandemic, the ability to work may be impacted by individuals contracting or being exposed to COVID-19, governmental requirements to postpone certain non-essential services in some of the Company\u2019s jurisdictions, or by management-imposed restrictions for safety precautions; to date, these factors have not had a significant impact on the Company\u2019s ability to maintain operations. Employees at many offices (including corporate headquarters) continue to work from home on a temporary basis and travel restrictions largely continue. Both segments initially implemented business continuity plans, including the deployment of technology to conduct administrative and critical functions remotely, where possible, and employees and management teams have effectively communicated and responded quickly to changes.

The global pandemic has resulted in a dramatic reduction in airline flights and has reduced the number of vehicles on the road.

The convergence of these events - the unprecedented dual impact of a severe global oil demand decline related to the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with a substantial increase in supply - drove oil prices to historically low levels and created significant volatility, uncertainty, and turmoil in the oil and gas industry. As a result, the price of oil was extremely depressed and even reached historic lows during the second quarter 2020, with the price of Brent crude bottoming to just under $20 per Bbl in mid April 2020. These market conditions prompted producers all over the world to shut-in production and delay new oil and gas projects. OPEC+ eventually announced production cuts in April 2020, and then in June 2020 agreed to extend the cuts through the end of July 2020. In August these production cuts were eased slightly and the output reduction levels remained through the end of 2020. In December 2020 and January 2021, OPEC+ agreed to cut production slightly beginning in January 2021 and will continue to reassess monthly."

These factors resulted in the price of Brent crude oil reaching a historic low of just under $20 per barrel during the second quarter of 2020.

We are continuing to monitor these directives where we have operations and/or offices and modify our workplace restrictions as necessary. Although we managed the transition to temporary work from home arrangements and subsequent office re-openings without a significant loss in business continuity, we incurred additional costs and experienced some inefficiencies during the year as a result. If the ongoing outbreak were to continue to worsen, and additional restrictions are implemented, certain operational and other business processes could slow which may result in longer time to execute critical business functions, higher operating costs and uncertainties regarding the quality of services and supplies, any of which could adversely affect our operating results for as long as the current pandemic persists and potentially for some time after the pandemic subsides.

International and U.S. governmental authorities in impacted regions are taking actions in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19, including issuing varying forms of \u201cstay-at-home\u201d orders, and restricting business functions outside of one\u2019s home. In response, we have implemented a work-from-home policy for certain of our employees. To date, we have been able to continue to supply our product candidates to our patients currently enrolled in our clinical trials, including for seralutinib, GB004 and GB1275, and do not currently anticipate any interruptions in supply. In addition, while we are continuing the clinical trials we have underway in sites across the globe, COVID-19 precautions have delayed, such as the previous pause in enrollment in our Phase 1b clinical trial for seralutinib in PAH earlier this year, and may continue to delay completion of these and future trials and may directly or indirectly impact the timeline for data readouts, initiation of, as well as monitoring, data collection and analysis and other related activities for, some of our current and future clinical trials. For example, our current expectations for how we will continue to enroll our Phase 2 clinical trials of seralutinib and GB004 are based on an assumption that clinical trial and healthcare activities begin to return to normal and clinical sites remain open or reopen during the first half of 2021 in light of the continued spread of COVID-19. In particular with respect to seralutinib, some PAH clinical trial sites are currently closed or limited as PAH patients may be at a higher risk of COVID-19 complications than the general population, and some PAH clinical trials may close again if there is a surge of COVID-19 cases in the specific geographies of such trial site locations. Therefore, our assumptions around enrollment timing may prove to be incorrect, in particular if COVID-19 continues to spread. In light of recent developments relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, and consistent with the FDA\u2019s updated industry guidance for conducting clinical trials, clinical trials may be deprioritized in favor of treating patients who have contracted the virus or to prevent the spread of the virus. This may lead to clinical trial protocol deviations or to discontinuation of treatment for patients who are currently enrolled in our trials. Any delays in the completion of our clinical trials, data analysis or readouts and any disruption in our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain, including as a result of new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain or treat it, as well as the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets."
