Natural gas is a cleaner-burning, abundant and affordable source of energy.  When LNG is converted back to natural gas, it can be used instead of coal, which reduces the amount of pollution traditionally produced from burning fossil fuels, like sulfur dioxide and particulate matter that enters the air we breathe.  Additionally, compared to coal, it produces significantly fewer carbon emissions.  By liquefying natural gas, we are able to reduce its volume by 600 times so that we can load it onto special LNG carriers designed to keep the LNG cold and in liquid form for efficient transport overseas.

In addition to travel restrictions put in place in early 2020, governments have closed borders, imposed prolonged quarantines and may continue those measures or implement other restrictions and requirements in light of the continuing spread of the pandemic.  We expect that these evolving restrictions and requirements, as well as the corresponding need to adapt to new methods of conducting business remotely, will continue to have an adverse effect on our business.

Extraordinary and wide-ranging actions have been taken by international, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities to contain and combat the spread of COVID-19, including stay-at-home or shelter-in-place orders, social distancing measures and travel restrictions for individuals, orders for many businesses to cease or curtail normal operations unless their work is deemed essential or critical and, recently, the approvals of various vaccines and subsequent roll-outs of large-scale vaccination programs worldwide. Some of these vaccines, while highly effective against the original virus strain, may be less effective against some of the newer and more contagious variants."

Entering into 2021, transportation remains challenged with multiple supply and international trade factors, after the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union led to equipment shortages, impacting availability. Through the year we see these factors waning as supply networks become stabilized with new global demand patterns and the reduced impact of COVID-19 through vaccination.

Pricing in the homeowners business is driven in large part by changes in the frequency of claims and changes in severity, including inflation in the cost of building supplies, labor and household possessions.  In addition to the normal risks associated with any multiple peril coverage, the profitability and pricing of both homeowners and automobile insurance are affected by the incidence of catastrophes and other weather-related events, as well as other unusual circumstances such as the impact of COVID-19 and related economic conditions.  Insurers writing personal lines property and casualty policies may be unable to change prices until some time after the costs associated with coverage have changed, primarily because of state insurance rate regulation. The pace at which an insurer can change rates in response to changing costs depends, in part, on whether the applicable state law requires prior approval of rate changes or notification to the regulator either before or after a rate change is imposed. In states with prior approval laws, rates must be approved by the regulator before being used by the insurer. In states having \u201cfile-and-use\u201d laws, the insurer must file rate changes with the regulator, but does not need to wait for approval before using the new rates.  A \u201cuse-and-file\u201d law requires an insurer to file rates within a period of time after the insurer begins using the new rate. Approximately one-half of the states require prior approval of most rate changes.  In addition, changes to methods of marketing and underwriting in some jurisdictions are subject to state-imposed restrictions, which can make it more difficult for an insurer to significantly manage catastrophe exposures.

Accordingly, under such incentive contracts, profit may also be adjusted up or down depending on whether specified performance objectives are met. Under our U.S. Government firm fixed-price and fixed-price incentive contracts, we generally receive from the U.S.\u00a0Government either milestone payments totaling 100\u00a0percent of the contract price or monthly progress payments in amounts equaling 80\u00a0percent of costs incurred under the contract (however, in response to the novel COVID-19 strain of coronavirus pandemic (\u201cCOVID\u201d), the U.S. Government has taken steps to increase the current rate for certain progress payments to 90 percent of costs incurred under relevant contracts to enhance cash flow and liquidity for the defense industrial base). The remaining amounts, including profits or incentive fees, are billed upon delivery and final acceptance of end items and deliverables under the contract.

The FDA also issued warning letters to companies for claiming their products prevented, treated, mitigated, diagnosed or cured COVID-19. The FTC and states' attorneys general from time to time have initiated investigations and enforcement actions against direct selling companies alleging that the companies operated a pyramid scheme. Although the FTC and states' attorneys general exercise a substantial degree of subjectivity in determining whether a company is operating a pyramid scheme, the FTC and states' attorneys general consider whether the compensation received by our independent consultants is based primarily on recruitment of other persons as participants in the compensation program and not on bona fide sales of products to consumers. The FTC and states' attorneys general have also initiated investigations and enforcement actions as a result of misleading representations relating to the earnings potential of independent consultants within a company\u2019s compensation plan. Additionally, in recent years, private watchdog groups have increased their attention on companies in the dietary supplement and direct selling industries with allegations of false or misleading product and earnings claims. Such private watchdog groups actively monitor dietary supplement and direct selling companies and their independent consultants with the goal of encouraging the FTC and/or states' attorneys general to take enforcement action against practices they believe are misleading or illegal. We cannot be sure that the FTC or states' attorneys general, or comparable foreign agencies, will not question our advertising claims, or advertising claims made by our independent consultants, in the future.

The spread of COVID-19 has caused illness, quarantines, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in business activity and financial transactions, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Federal, State and Local governments have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations, advising or requiring individuals to limit or forgo their time outside of their homes, and ordering temporary closures of businesses that have been deemed to be non-essential.  The initial restrictions and other consequences of the pandemic resulted in significant adverse effects for many different types of businesses, including, among others, those in the retail sales, travel, hospitality and food and beverage industries, and resulted in a significant number of layoffs and furloughs of employees nationwide and in the markets in which we operate.  Restrictions have been at least partially lifted nationally and within the Company's operating footprint with some level of economic recovery resulting.  While progress towards vaccination has been made, an increase in virus spread or infection rates, or the emergence of new variants of the virus could result in restrictions being re-implemented with further negative impact to economic activity."

This trend of increasing sales volume continued through our third and fourth quarters, resulting in the Company achieving a record for new contracts in 2020, along with records in a number of other operating and financial metrics.  We believe that the homebuilding industry benefited from record-low interest rates, a continued undersupply of available homes and a desire of many consumers to move from rental apartments and densely populated areas to single family homes in suburban locations. We believe these factors will continue to support demand into 2021, subject to the economic uncertainties caused by the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Company-wide, our absorption pace of sales per community in 2020 improved to 3.7 per month compared to 2.6 per month in 2019.  Our average sales price in backlog increased in 2020 by 6%.  Partially as a result of this accelerated sales pace, we sold out of some communities earlier and our number of active communities declined to 202 at the end of 2020 from 225 at the end of 2019.  We  continued to place additional land under contract for communities that will be brought online in future periods, and controlled approximately 39,500 lots at December 31, 2020.  Our ability to timely replace existing communities could further impact our number of active communities.   We continue to work to open new communities, and we are also actively managing sales pace, in part by selectively increasing prices, to better match our availability of lots and production schedule.",

The estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital (modified CECL transitional amount) is calculated as the sum of the day-one impact on retained earnings upon adoption of CECL (CECL transitional amount) and the calculated change in the ACL relative to the day-one ACL upon adoption of CECL multiplied by a scaling factor of 25%. The scaling factor is used to approximate the difference in the ACL under CECL relative to the incurred loss methodology.

Post COVID-19, demand was driven by favorable market factors including historically-low mortgage interest rates, a limited supply of existing homes and an increased demand for healthier, safer homes. We believe the strengthening demand experienced throughout the year reflects the sustained positive macroeconomic factors in the economy allowing more people to own their own homes. We believe demand for affordable new homes will at least keep pace with demand for other home offerings for the short to mid-term. Accordingly, homebuilders with attractive, lower price-point product in desirable locations with inventory available for quick move-in should be poised to capture this demand for nicely appointed but affordable homes.

During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had minimal impact on global crop production. Most farm operations, which generally have been deemed essential, operated at normal levels. However, the consumption of grain for food, fuel and livestock feed was negatively impacted by the economic constraints caused by the pandemic in the first half of 2020. During the second half of 2020, grain consumption started to recover, consistent with improving economic activities and increased grain exports to China, thus reducing forecasts for ending grain inventories, and raising soft commodity prices. Consequently, global industry demand for farm equipment was mixed during 2020 but improved in the second half of the year across major markets. Farm income, which is a function of commodity and protein prices, crop yields, and government support, will continue to be a key factor in the level of industry demand.",

As such, our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity, financial condition and capital spending plans of freight railroads and passenger transit agencies around the world, and transportation equipment manufacturers who serve those markets.  Many factors influence these industries, including general economic conditions; traffic volumes, as measured by freight carloadings and passenger ridership; government spending on public transportation; and investment in new technologies.  In general, trends such as increasing urbanization and growth in developing markets, a focus on sustainability and environmental awareness, increasing investment in technology solutions, an aging equipment fleet, and growth in global trade are expected to drive continued investment in freight rail and passenger transit.",
        "match": "According to the 2020 bi-annual edition of a market study by UNIFE, the Association of the European Rail Industry, the accessible global market for railway products and services is more than $120 billion and is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 2.3% through 2025. As the long-term effects of COVID-19 are still uncertain, UNIFE included a second, less likely scenario in which the recovery is more moderate. This alternative scenario shows a compounded annual growth rate of 0.9% through 2025 for the total accessible market. The three largest geographic markets, which represented about 85% of the total accessible market, were Europe, North America and Asia Pacific. UNIFE projected above-average growth rates in Latin America, Eastern Europe, North America, and Africa/Middle East, with the more mature markets of Western Europe, North America, and Asia Pacific accounting for the largest share of absolute growth. UNIFE said trends such as urbanization, digitalization, legislative action and government support, and an increased focus on energy and environmental issues continue to drive investment. The largest product segments of the market were rolling stock, services and infrastructure, which represent almost 90% of the accessible market.  UNIFE projected spending growth in all product segments, with turnkey management projects, rolling stock, and infrastructure to grow fastest. UNIFE estimated that the global installed base of diesel and electric locomotives was about 118,200 units, with about 32% in Asia Pacific, about 25% in North America and about 18% in Russia-CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States).\u00a0\u00a0Wabtec estimates that about 3,000 new locomotives were delivered worldwide in 2020.  UNIFE estimated the global installed base of freight cars was about 5.2 million, with about 35% in North America, about 24% in Russia-CIS, and about 24% in Asia Pacific.  Wabtec estimates that about 155,000 new freight cars were delivered worldwide in 2020.\u00a0\u00a0UNIFE estimated the global installed base of passenger transit vehicles to be about 620,000 units, with about 45% in Asia Pacific, about 31% in Europe and about 10% in Russia-CIS. Wabtec estimates that about 32,000 new passenger transit vehicles were ordered worldwide in 2020.",
        "after": "In Europe, the majority of the rail system serves the passenger transit market, which is expected to continue growing as energy and environmental policies encourage continued investment in public mass transit, and modal shift from car to rail, although this growth may be stunted in the near-term as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to UNIFE, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom were the largest Western European transit markets, representing about two-thirds of industry spending in the European Union. UNIFE projected the accessible Western European rail market to grow at about 2.0% annually, led by investments in new rolling stock in France and Germany.\u00a0\u00a0About 75% of freight traffic in Europe is hauled by truck, while rail accounts for about 19%. The largest freight markets in Europe are Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom. In recent years, the European Commission has adopted a series of measures designed to increase the efficiency of the European rail network by standardizing operating rules and certification requirements.  UNIFE believes that adoption of these measures should have a positive effect on ridership and investment in public transportation over time."

However, in terms of homeowners investing in their existing homes, discretionary expenditures, including backyard renovations, have flourished over this time period with steady increases in home values and lack of affordable new homes prompting homeowners to stay in their homes longer and upgrade their home environments, including their backyards.  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, many families spent more time at home and sought out opportunities to create or expand existing home-based outdoor living and entertainment spaces, which resulted in an increase in new pool construction and greater expenditures for maintenance and remodeling products, despite the overall decline in economic activity in the U.S.  While we estimate that new pool construction increased from approximately 80,000 units in 2019 to approximately 100,000 units in 2020, construction levels are still down approximately 55% compared to peak historical levels and down approximately 40% from what we consider normal levels.  An average of approximately 170,000 new units per year were built in the years leading up to the Great Recession.  We expect that new pool and irrigation construction levels will continue to grow incrementally, but we believe that consumer investments in outdoor living spaces beyond the swimming pool will generate greater growth over the next several years.

This included increasing our focus on driving digital sales where customers utilize ordering interaction that is primarily facilitated by automated technology.  In 2020, our system restaurants generated digital sales of $17 billion, which represented an approximate 45% increase over 2019.  Additionally, the number of restaurants that now offer delivery increased to over 35,000 restaurants, which represents over 70% of our global system.",

During 2021, the availability of steel was negatively impacted by shortages and disruption in the steel industry as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and during Q1 2022, the availability of foam in the U.S. has been negatively impacted by disruption in the foam supply chain as a result of a severe weather event.  These reductions in availability have not had a significant impact on our ability to manufacture and supply products to our customers, but they have negatively impacted the cost of procuring such materials.  In addition, the prices for many of the raw materials, components and finished goods we procure have fluctuated in recent years due to changes in global supply and demand, and the costs of these items can be impacted by changes in import tariffs and trade barriers.

For example, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions in response to alleged privacy and data security violations. Further, certain states have proposed or enacted legislation that will create new data privacy and security obligations for certain entities, such a the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which came into effect January 1, 2020 and was recently amended and expanded by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) passed on November 3, 2020. The CCPA and CPRA, among other things, create new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also created a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. It remains unclear what, if any, additional modifications will be made to the CPRA by the California legislature or how it will be interpreted.

Our technology enables consumers to connect with businesses through these same preferred conversational interfaces, including Facebook Messenger, SMS, WhatsApp, Apple Business Chat, Google Rich Business Messenger and Alexa.

For example, consumers can look up product info like ratings, images and pricing, search for stores, see product inventory, schedule appointments, apply for credit, approve repairs, and make purchases or payments - all without ever leaving the messaging channel.

While we have always had distributed teams collaborating around the globe, the COVID-19 pandemic provided an unexpected experiment in remote work, as the vast majority of our employees pivoted to working from home starting in March 2020. In May 2020, we announced that most employees will continue to have the option to work remotely even after we reopen our offices. This flexible location policy has unlocked opportunities to source, connect, and hire talent in more locations. We believe it will also enable us to retain talent, as employees can continue to work for Synchronoss if they need or want to relocate.",

However, the absence of these words or similar expressions does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking.

Further, actual results may be affected by competition on price and other factors with other financial institutions; customer acceptance of new products and services; the regulatory environment in which we operate; and general trends in the local, regional and national banking industry and economy.

While the evolution of healthcare delivery began prior to the pandemic, we believe COVID-19 has highlighted the need for dynamic healthcare providers with the ability to shift with changes in market conditions.  In addition, we believe that the pandemic has accelerated the shift in medical care towards lower-cost outpatient settings.  Although outpatient visits fell by approximately 60% in the spring of 2020, by late summer 2020, many restrictions on travel and nonessential services were lifted.  By September 2020, outpatient visits had rebounded, returning to pre-pandemic levels. However, future impacts to market dynamics as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic are not certain at this time. "

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, in recent years commercial air traffic growth expanded at a rate 1.3 to 2 times that of global GDP growth. The expansion of air travel has driven the growth in the world aircraft fleet; there are approximately 24,000 commercial mainline passenger and freighter aircraft in the world fleet today. Aircraft leasing companies own approximately 47% of the world\u2019s commercial jet aircraft. Under normal circumstances, we would expect the global fleet to continue expanding at a two to four percent average annual rate.",
        "after": "The COVID-19 crisis has had an unprecedented negative impact on the global economy, and in particular on the aviation sector. As a result of COVID-19, there has been a dramatic slowdown in air traffic, with some markets in near complete shutdown. While there have been some limited improvements in certain markets recently, according to IATA, as of February 2021, air travel was still down to approximately 30% of normal levels and a full recovery to pre-pandemic levels is not expected for several years. IATA estimates this situation will cost the airline industry over $510 billion of lost revenue, a number which may be revised upwards. Substantially all of the world\u2019s airlines are experiencing financial difficulties and liquidity challenges, including many of our customers. According to IATA, total net losses for the airline industry will reach $126 billion in 2020 and $48 billion in 2021. This could affect our lessees\u2019 ability to fulfill their lease payment obligations to us.  While we believe long-term demand for air travel will return to historical trends over time, the near-term impacts of the COVID-19 economic shock are material; the extent and duration of those impacts cannot currently be determined."

According to TradeTech, world uranium requirements continue to exceed primary mine production, with the gap being bridged by secondary supplies and excess uranium inventories in various forms that have already been mined. In addition, it is the Company's belief that additional mine production cutbacks will be required to bring the market into balance in the short and medium terms. However, a large portion of global uranium production is state-owned and state-subsidized, and therefore not subject to normal market fundamentals. It is for this reason that the Company supports the creation of the proposed U.S. Uranium Reserve to ensure the U.S. has sufficient uranium mining capacity to meet national security and energy security needs. The Company estimates that, for 2020, well less than 1% of U.S. reactor demand was met by new production from U.S. uranium mines. The Company has believed for several years that market forces will cause uranium prices, and long-term contracting levels in particular, to return to levels that are sufficient to incentivize new mine production. However, it is the Company\u2019s belief that secondary supplies, inventories, and non-free market forces have delayed this recovery."

In May 2019, we acquired certain land, water rights, state grazing leases for cattle, and other related assets from Dinwiddie Cattle Company that support oil and gas development in the Permian Basin in southeast New Mexico. Our other oilfield related products and service offerings include, but are not limited to, caliche, right-of-way agreements, surface damages and easements, and a produced water royalty. We refer to these assets and operations as \"Intrepid South.\" Due to the strategic location of Intrepid South, part of our long-term operating strategy is selling small parcels of land, including restricted use agreements of surface or subsurface rights, to customers, where such sales provide a solution to a customer's operations in the oil and gas industry. We sell water on Intrepid South under a joint marketing agreement with NGL Energy Partners, a land and water rights owner adjacent to our South property. Under this agreement, we are responsible for the marketing, sale, and delivery of water to various customers across our combined acreage. Demand for water and other oilfield related products and services is due to oil and gas activity and development in southeast New Mexico. During 2020, oil prices declined due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and oil and gas drilling operations also declined in 2020 compared to 2019. However, oil and gas drilling activities have increased from the lowest levels reported early in the third quarter of 2020. ",

Beginning in early April 2020, we began processing loan applications under the PPP, and in January 2021, we began processing applications under this latest round of the PPP.

Seralutinib has been generally well tolerated in completed clinical trials. In contrast to the three classes of marketed vasodilatory therapies for PAH, we believe that seralutinib has the potential to be disease-modifying by addressing the cellular overgrowth, fibrosis and vascular remodeling which underlie PAH. Inhaled seralutinib, which is designed to act on both isoforms of the PDGFR, \u03b1 and \u03b2, as well as the CSF1R and c-KIT pathways, inhibited and reversed cellular overgrowth in lung blood vessels in multiple animal PAH models. In 2013, results from a Phase 3 clinical trial in PAH of imatinib (Gleevec), an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor with known activity against PDGF and c-KIT, marketed for oncology indications, showed statistically significant improvement in its primary efficacy endpoint, however systemic toxicities were also observed. To date, these toxicities have not been observed with seralutinib in our completed Phase 1 single-ascending dose / multiple ascending dose, or SAD / MAD, studies in healthy volunteers or in our Phase 1b study in PAH patients. In the two-week Phase 1b clinical trial in PAH patients, seralutinib demonstrated rapid systemic clearance, target engagement via whole blood CSF1R stabilization assay and was generally well tolerated. We commenced the Phase 2 TORREY trial in PAH patients in December 2020. Topline results from this trial are expected in the first half of 2022, subject to developments in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We in-licensed seralutinib from Pulmokine, Inc. in 2017 and retain worldwide rights.
