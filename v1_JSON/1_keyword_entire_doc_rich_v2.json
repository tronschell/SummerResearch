Concurrent with the enactment of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020, as amended (the CARES Act), discussed further below, federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that delayed the estimated impact on regulatory capital resulting from the adoption of CECL. The interim final rule provided banking organizations that implemented CECL prior to the end of 2020 the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital relative to regulatory capital determined under the prior incurred loss methodology, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay. On August 26, 2020, the bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that made certain technical changes to the interim final rule, including expanding the pool of eligible institutions. The changes in the final rule applied only to those banking organizations that elected the CECL transition relief provided for under the rule. Under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (the CAA), discussed further below, bank holding companies and their affiliates now have the option of postponing implementation of CECL until the earlier of (i) the end of the national emergency declaration related to COVID-19 or (ii) December 31, 2022.

Due to the growth of emerging economies and elevated standards of living, more people desire and are able to afford automobiles. The number of vehicles utilizing the world\u2019s roadway infrastructure is growing at a quicker pace than new roads, bridges and highways are being constructed.\u00a0 According to the Federal Highway Administration, American drivers put a record 3.28 trillion miles on public roads and highways in 2019, an increase of 0.6% from 3.26 trillion miles in 2018. However, we believe the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have caused traffic congestion in the U.S. to decrease somewhat in 2020 and 2021, although we expect it to increase as the pandemic subsides due to increased vaccination rates and the removal of stay-at-home and other restrictive mandates.\u00a0Overall, the growth in roadway infrastructure is failing to match the surge in the number of vehicles using it. Above-ground detection-based traffic management and control systems address the problem by monitoring high traffic areas and analyzing data that can be used to mitigate traffic problems.",

Because automobiles can be introduced to a metropolitan area faster than roadway infrastructure can be constructed, the result is continuously worsening traffic.

Detection is the requisite common denominator for any technology\u2011based solution."

Juliet is a versatile multi-application platform utilizing an Er:YAG laser with the 2940 nm wavelength. This Erbium wavelength produces noticeable results due to its high peak absorption in water. Additionally, Juliet\u2019s Erbium technology allows for a controlled thermal delivery to tissue, keeping the procedure safe for patients while minimizing downtime. Juliet delivers two passes of energy to the target area during treatment. The first pass uses ablation to vaporize the tissue and create micro-channels of injury. The second pass uses coagulation to deliver a thermal injury to the area, which further stimulates the body's normal wound healing process, revitalizing, and remodeling damaged tissue and introducing the formation of new blood vessels. Juliet also has a disposable tip, which must be changed for every procedure. As a result, the replacement of the tips results in recurring revenue. The Company is the distributor of Juliet. All regulatory activities are managed by Asclepion laser technologies gmbh, the legal manufacturer. During the quarter ended June 30, 2020, the Company wrote-off $0.8 million of inventory on hand related to its Juliet platform due to declining sales.
