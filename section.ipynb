In addition, the Company experienced inefficiencies in its manufacturing and distribution due to social distancing measures imposed in its facilities, COVID-19 related absenteeism, and higher than normal turnover and training of replacements, together with associated costs. ', 'The increases and decreases in the demand for the Company’s products described above have continued to affect the Company’s operations through the end of fiscal year 2020 and continue to do so through the date of this report. They are likely to continue to do so in the immediate future. For example, a decrease could occur in the demand for its first aid and safety products as a result of market saturation potentially resulting from customers having stockpiled those products. While there is no certainty that the current high levels of demand for our first aid and safety products will continue, we have increased our short-term manufacturing and sourcing capacity for these products. We also increased manufacturing and sourcing of other key components and finished goods to minimize the impact of any disruption to our supply chain in the event of a resurgence of an outbreak of the coronavirus in any of our key manufacturing or distribution facilities.

However, any prolonged increase in the duration or severity of the COVID-19 pandemic or a resurgence of the pandemic in the future, might adversely affect the Company’s ability to manufacture, source or distribute its products both domestically and internationally.

Also contributing to the growth in first aid products was a surge demand related to the COVID-19 pandemic which had commenced late in the first quarter. These sales amounted to approximately $3.0 million in the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.', 'Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $48,182,050 in 2020 compared with $43,571,510 in 2019, an increase of $4,610,540, or 10.6%. SG&A expenses were 29.4% of net sales in 2020 compared to 30.6% in 2019. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily due to higher personnel related costs, commissions and shipping costs related to higher sales, provision for bad debt primarily related to the impact COVID-19 on our customers, as well as added expenses related to the acquisition of First Aid Central, partially offset by lower travel and marketing expenses.', 'During 2020, working capital increased by approximately $6.9 million compared to December 31, 2019.

Inventory turnover, calculated using a twelve month average inventory balance, was 2.4 at December 31, 2020 as compared to 2.3 at December 31, 2019.
